            <h3>You&rsquo;ve reached the homework assignment webpage of Billy Kalb</h3>

            <p>As part of my course work for the Starter League&rsquo;s <em>HTML/CSS</em> class, I&rsquo;m coding up this web page about myself.</p>

            <figure class="left">
                <img src="mustaches.jpg" alt="Dressed up with fake mustaches">

            <p>I've lived in Chicago, IL since 2004. Before that, I grew up in suburban Minneapolis, MN. The Twin Cities are great, but Chicago is my home, and I can&rsquo;t imagine living anywhere else.</p>

            <p>Specifically, I live on the east side of Chicago&rsquo;s Humboldt Park neighborhood, close enough to Ukrainian Village that the two areas blur. My neighbors are all hipsters, tiny Ukrainian grandmothers, and tattooed Puerto Rican motorcycle mechanics. It's a great place to be.</p>

            <p>My favorite person in the world is a lady named Maddie, who I'm marrying next August. She won&rsquo;t let me call her my &lsquo;fiancé&rsquo; &mdash; she prefers &lsquo;future wife&rsquo; because it&rsquo;s funnier. We met in college while working at the student newspaper; she&rsquo;s a graphic designer by trade and now works for a magazine publisher. She likes my dumb jokes and is just about as nerdy as I am, so I figured I should probably keep her around.</p>

            <figure class="right">
                <img src="hotbun.jpg" alt="The bunny is a boozehound">
                <figcaption>This is why we can't have nice things.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>It was Maddie&rsquo;s idea to get a pet rabbit a couple years ago. I was skeptical, but she really wanted one, so we adopted an albino miniature rex and named him Mister Sinister. He&rsquo;s nothing but trouble (and he&rsquo;s got a taste for beer and spicy food), but he&rsquo;s got other redeeming qualities, so now we have a second rabbit, Brünhilde, to keep him company. She&rsquo;s also trouble, but in different ways.</p>

            <p>And about that beer &mdash; there&rsquo;s plenty of it around our house because I brew my own with the help of a few friends. We set up a 20-gallon kettle on a propane burner in the garage every few weeks to make a new batch, and I&rsquo;m told it&rsquo;s pretty good. Maybe someday we&rsquo;ll start an actual brewery.</p>

            <p>When I&rsquo;m not turning malt sugar into alcohol or working on keeping Mister S. away from the Sriracha bottle, I like to make stuff: I enjoy cooking, gardening, designing, and coding. I ride my bicycle everywhere I can, even if the weather sucks. I read a lot of classic superhero comics, and I really enjoy music. In 2010, I helped launch CHIRP Radio, a volunteer-driven local community radio station, where I put in more than five years as the founding music director. I&rsquo;m not as involved anymore, but I&rsquo;m still around as a member of the organization&rsquo;s board of directors. And just to thoroughly sabotage my own indie cred, I DJ with a friend once a month at the Whistler in Logan Square, where we do a night of stupidly sincere &rsquo;90s pop and hip hop. We call ourselves The TTTTotally Dudes. I have no idea why.</p>
